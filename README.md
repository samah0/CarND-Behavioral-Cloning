# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning
Behavioral Cloning Project
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
• Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
• Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering
angles from images
• Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
• Test that the model successfully drives around track one without
leaving the road
• Summarize the results with a written report

 Using the Udacity provided simulator and drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing
$ python drive.py model.h5

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works. To train the model execute the following command:
$ python model.py
